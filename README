** LIBFOA - A Fast Object and Array encoding library **

** GENERAL:

   This is a library implementation of the FOA encoding, an encoding
   specially designed to be an alternative to XML for data exchange
   between web services. It can also useful as a general encoding
   format similar to JSON.

** LICENSE:

   This FOA library is released under the Lesser GNU General Public License
   (LGPL). Thus you are allowed to use it in commercial applications.
   
   However, as a free software developer I encourage you to release your 
   software under GPL or similar licenses.

** DESIGN:

   The FOA encoding was designed to be used as an object and array streaming
   algorithm providing efficient transfer of data between networked
   computers. It's memory footprint is small because it will never use more
   memory than required by you longest single line of data to decode.

** VALIDATION:

   At current the library will *not* perform any validation except for some
   simple checks. If you want validation, use foa_scan() or foa_next() and
   implement you own lexical analyzer.
   
** ENCODING/DECODING:

   The characters '(', ')', '[' and ']' are special to FOA. These are used
   to denote the start and end of encoded object and arrays. See doc/README.FOA 
   for more information. 
   
   Another special char is the assignment '=' that is used to name objects
   and arrays, as well as support named simple data. In some way this is
   used to support data structures like Perl or PHP hashes.
