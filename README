** LIBFOA - A Fast Object and Array encoding library **

** GENERAL:

   This is a library implementation of the FOA encoding, an encoding
   designed to be used as an alternative to XML for data exchange
   between i.e. web services. It can also useful as a general encoding
   format similar to JSON.

** LICENSE:

   This FOA library is released under the Lesser GNU General Public License
   (LGPL). That means you are allowed to use it in commercial applications.    
   However, as a free software developer I encourage you to release your 
   software under GPL or similar licenses.

** DESIGN:

   The FOA encoding was designed to efficient encode and decode objects and 
   arrays thats transfered between networked computers. It's memory footprint 
   is small, it will never use more memory than required by you longest single
   line of data to decode.

** VALIDATION:

   At current the library will *not* perform any validation except for some
   simple checks. If you want validation, use foa_scan() or foa_next() and
   implement you own lexical analyzer.
   
** ENCODING/DECODING:

   The characters '(', ')', '[' and ']' are special to FOA. These are used
   to denote the start and end of encoded object and arrays. See doc/README.FOA 
   for more information. 
   
   The assignment '=' character is another special char that is used to name
   data, objects and arrays. By naming data its possible to support exchange
   of data structures, like Perl or PHP hashes.
