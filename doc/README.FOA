** Encoding objects and arrays in FOA **

** EXAMPLES:

   Here are some example of encoding arrays and objects:
   
     struct person
     {
         int age;
         const char *name;
     };
   
     struct person someone = { 32, "Ceasar" };
   
   The person object gets encoded as:
   
     (
     32
     Ceasar
     )
   
   Now consider an array:
   
     const char **names = { "Adam", "Bertil" };     /* C */

   This gets encoded as:
     
     [
     Adam
     Bertil
     ]
     
   It's also possible to nest objects and arrays within each other. Heres
   an example of an array of persons:
   
     struct person register[] = {{ 41, "David" }, { 28, "Erik" }};
     
   This gets encoded as:
   
     [
     (
     41
     David
     )
     (
     28
     Erik
     )
     ]

** SPECIAL CHARACTERS:

   If your exchanged data will possibly contain one of the special 
   characters "([])", then these can be encoded as well. FOA uses HTTP
   encoding scheme for these:
   
     ( -> %28
     [ -> %5B
     ] -> %5D
     ) -> %29
